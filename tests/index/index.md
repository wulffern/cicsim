cicsim is a collection of scripts that I use to simplify my life when it comes
to
analog simulation.

cicsim is short for Custom Integrated Circuit Simulation (or Carsten's
Integrated Circuit Simulation). 

I pronounce `cicsim` as C I C SIM, while my students sometimes call it 'sick-sim'.

The commands are 

<!--run_output:
run: cicsim --help
-->
