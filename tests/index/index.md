cicsim is a collection of scripts that I use to simplify my life when it comes
to
analog simulation.

cicsim is short for Custom Integrated Circuit Simulation (or Carsten's
Integrated Circuit Simulation). 

I pronounce `cicsim` as C I C SIM, while my students sometimes call it 'sick-sim'.

The commands are 

<!--run_output:
run: cicsim --help
-->


## Install stable version 

I sometimes release a version to pypi, so you can do 

```
python3 -m pip install cicsim
```

## Install latest and greatest 

```
git clone https://github.com/wulffern/cicsim
cd cicsim
python3 -m pip install --user -e .
```
